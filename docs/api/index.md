# API Reference

## Authentication

Inbound authentication is optional. When the gateway starts with both `OIDC_ISSUER` and `OIDC_AUDIENCE`, every
`/v1/*` HTTP route and the `/v1/responses` WebSocket upgrade require an OIDC `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.
`/health` and `/ready` remain public. Supplying only one OIDC setting is a startup error.

The gateway treats `OIDC_AUDIENCE` as the complete audience trust set: every `aud` value must equal it, and any
present `azp` value must also equal it. It also validates the token signature, issuer, subject, expiration, and
not-before time. The identity token is consumed at the gateway boundary instead of being forwarded to the inference
service. WebSocket sessions reject new `response.create` messages after the validated token expires.

Missing or rejected credentials return `401 Unauthorized` with `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer`. OpenAI-compatible routes
use this envelope:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "message": "invalid bearer token",
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "param": null,
    "code": "invalid_token"
  }
}
```

`/v1/messages` and `/v1/messages/count_tokens` use the Anthropic-compatible envelope:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "error": {
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "message": "invalid bearer token"
  },
  "request_id": "req_019..."
}
```

The same `req_`-prefixed identifier is returned in the `request-id` response header.

A JWKS refresh failure returns `503 Service Unavailable`, without `WWW-Authenticate`, so clients can distinguish an
identity-provider dependency failure from rejected credentials. See
[OIDC bearer authentication](../design/oidc-bearer-authentication.md) for configuration and key-cache behavior.
For a complete GitHub-backed deployment example, see
[GitHub authentication with Dex](../deploying/github-oidc.md).

## Responses

### `POST /v1/responses`

HTTP Responses requests use the OpenAI-compatible Responses shape. Requests
with `store=true`, `previous_response_id`, `conversation_id`, compaction input,
or `context_management` run through the executor. Other stateless `store=false`
requests are passed directly to the configured vLLM backend.

Executor-backed requests accept at most 64 MCP server declarations and 128
discovered MCP tools. MCP discovery metadata shares the request's 1 MiB
response budget with upstream rounds and gateway tool output.

### `POST /v1/responses/compact`

Compacts direct input or a stored previous-response chain into a canonical
window of retained user messages plus one `compaction` item. See
[Responses compaction](../guides/responses-compaction.md) for request examples,
automatic threshold management, and the local plaintext limitation.

### `WS /v1/responses`

The same path accepts WebSocket upgrades for Codex-style Responses
continuations. Send one JSON text frame per turn:

```json
{
  "type": "response.create",
  "stream_id": "turn-1",
  "model": "test-model",
  "input": [{"type": "message", "role": "user", "content": "hi"}],
  "previous_response_id": "resp_optional",
  "store": true,
  "stream": true
}
```

The server normalizes the frame into the internal Responses request model and
uses the same response-store continuation path as HTTP. WebSocket replies are
JSON Responses stream events, including `response.created`,
`response.output_item.added`, `response.output_text.delta`, and
`response.completed`.

Set `stream_id` to a string containing 1 to 256 characters to multiplex
responses over one connection. Requests with different `stream_id` values can
run concurrently, while requests with the same value run first in, first out.
Every event for an accepted request, including an execution error event, echoes
its `stream_id`.
Requests that omit `stream_id` share a default first-in, first-out lane for
backward compatibility. A connection accepts at most 64 outstanding requests and
12 MiB of aggregate request data; additional requests receive a `429` error event
until capacity is available. Upstream SSE lines are limited to 256 KiB, normalized
executor events are limited to 1 MiB, and each request shares a 1 MiB response
budget across MCP discovery, upstream rounds, and normalized gateway tool output.
Every outbound WebSocket event, including `stream_id`, is limited to 1 MiB of
serialized JSON. Local `generate: false` requests validate both lifecycle events
before storing the response or emitting either event. OIDC identity expiry is
checked again when queued work starts, including work in the default lane;
expired work receives a tagged `invalid_token` event without reaching inference.

Invalid requests are returned as JSON WebSocket error events:

```json
{
  "type": "error",
  "stream_id": "turn-1",
  "status": 404,
  "error": {
    "message": "human-readable error details",
    "type": "not_found",
    "code": "not_found"
  }
}
```
